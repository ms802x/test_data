# Saudi Sign Language (SSL) Challenge

## Overview
Welcome to the Saudi Sign Language (SSL) Challenge, organized by IEEE in collaboration with SDAIA and KFUPM. This competition focuses on advancing sign language recognition for SSL by addressing challenges like unseen signers, unseen sentences, and face-covering conditions.

## Task Description
Participants will develop models to translate SSL signs into text. There are three tracks:

- **Track 1 - Model Generalization on Unseen Signers**: Recognize SSL signs performed by unseen signers, but with seen sentences.
- **Track 2 - Model Generalization on Unseen Sentences**: Recognize SSL signs performed by seen signers, but with unseen sentences.
- **Track 3 - Model Generalization on Unseen Signers and Sentences**: Recognize SSL signs performed by fully unseen signers and sentences.

## Base Line Results:
The baseline results for each track are shown in the following table:


## Training Code
The training code can be found in blah blah, 

## Submission Guidelines
Submit predictions on unseen singers and sentences.
